## Features

- **User login with email and password** (simulated functionality)
- **Secure dashboard access** upon successful login
- **Side navigation bar** for seamless switching between:
  - Stock monitoring section
  - Bank statement section
- **Logout button** for user session termination

## Prerequisites

- A text editor or code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)
- A live server extension or application (e.g., Live Server for Visual Studio Code, Python's SimpleHTTPServer)
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Instructions

### Clone or Download the Project

- If using Git, clone the project repository using:

  ```bash
  git clone https://docs.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository
  ```

- Otherwise, download the project files as a ZIP archive.

### Open Files in a Code Editor

- Open the project directory (containing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files) in your preferred code editor.

### Run a Live Server

- Use a live server extension or application to start a local server for development purposes. This will allow you to view the HTML files in your web browser without needing to deploy them to a web server.
- Follow the specific instructions for your chosen live server tool.

### Access Login Page

- In your web browser, navigate to the URL provided by your live server (e.g., `http://localhost:5500/login.html`). This address might vary depending on your live server setup.

## Additional Notes

- This README provides a general overview. Specific implementation details may vary depending on your project's structure and logic.
- For user login functionality, consider using server-side scripting and database interaction to ensure secure authentication and data management. This implementation might involve languages like PHP, Python, or Node.js.
- The stock monitoring and bank statement sections might require additional libraries or APIs to fetch real-time data (if applicable). Refer to relevant documentation for such integrations.
